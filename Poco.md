**5. Event-Driven Programming**

Poco’s event-driven architecture is a powerful tool for designing responsive and efficient C++ applications, especially for managing asynchronous tasks, inter-component communication, and creating modular systems with minimal coupling. Here’s how you can leverage Poco's Event Handling and Notification Center:

**a. Event Handling in Poco**

Poco provides various utilities that allow you to implement event-driven programming using techniques like the Observer pattern, where objects can subscribe to or observe events and react to them asynchronously.

Key Components:
- Poco::BasicEvent: A template class for defining events. It allows you to declare events that can notify multiple observers when triggered.
- Poco::Delegate: Binds member functions (event handlers) to events.
- Poco::Observer: Binds the event to a callback function of the observer object.
- Basic Example: Event and Observer Pattern

**b. Notification Center**

The Notification Center in Poco is designed for managing messages and events between different components of an application in a decoupled fashion. It works as a hub for sending and receiving notifications.

Key Components:
- Poco::Notification: The base class for all notifications.
- Poco::NotificationCenter: A class that manages notifications and allows observers to subscribe to certain notification types.
