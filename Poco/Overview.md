"Without a good library, most interesting tasks are hard to do in C++; but given a good library, almost any task can be made easy."

Bjarne Stroustrup
(designer and original implementor of C++)

**1.POCO Objectives and Mission**
- POCO is a powerful, yet easy to use platform to build your applications upon
- POCO allows you to build highly portable applications (write once – compile and run anywhere)
- POCO is modular and scalable from embedded to enterprise applications (you only pay for what you use)
- POCO provides consistent, comprehensive and comprehensible programming interfaces
- POCO is written in fast, efficient C++
- POCO favors simplicity over complexity ("as simple as possible, but not simpler")
- POCO aims for consistency in design, coding style and documentation
- POCO emphasizes source code quality, in terms of readability, comprehensiveness, consistency, style and testability
- POCO aims to make C++ programming fun again

**2 .Guiding Principles**
- Strong focus on code quality, style, consistency and code readability –all code must satisfy our coding styleguide (and it works – we frequently get compliments on our code quality)
- Strong focus on tests (automated unit tests with high coverage)
- Favor pragmatic and elegant design over "solving all the worlds problems" (if we can satisfy 95 % of all use cases with an elegant solution, and the remaining 5 % would require an overly complex design, we focus on the 95 %)
- Build on top of solid foundations – use existing proven C libraries (e.g., expat, zlib, PCRE, SQLite) where it makes sense

**3 .POCO Benefits & Features**
- Comprehensive, complete and mature C++ frameworks that save lots of work and help bringing the product to market sooner.
- Easy learning curve through intuitive, consistent and comprehensible programming interfaces, lots of sample code and good documentation.
- Native C++ code performance (no VM overhead, etc.), low memory requirements.
- Platform independence: write once – compile and run everywhere.
- In many cases, a large part of an application (everything that does not need access to specific hardware) can be tested and debugged on the development host.
- An application can be easily ported to a new platform.
