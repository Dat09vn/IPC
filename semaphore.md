**What is Semaphores?**

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used to manage access to shared resources in concurrent programming. It helps prevent race conditions by controlling how many threads or processes can access a resource simultaneously.

Semaphores typically have two main operations:
- Wait (P): Also called acquire, this operation decreases the semaphore count. If the count is greater than zero, it allows the thread/process to proceed. If it's zero, the thread/process will block until the count becomes positive again.
- Signal (V): Also called release, this operation increases the semaphore count, potentially unblocking a waiting thread.

**Key Concepts**
- Race Conditions: It occurs when some common shared resources are accessed by multiple processes or threads, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- Deadlocks: a situation occurs when two or more processes are holding the resources and do not release them causing a deadlock to occur because another is waiting for that resources. Deadlock prevention and detection mechanisms are critical in process synchronization.

**Synchronization Techniques Include:**
- Mutex(Mutual Exclusion): only one process can access the critical section at a time, it is a locking mechanism.
- Semaphores: Signaling mechanisms to control access to shared resources.

**Types of Semaphores**
- Binary Semaphore: This is also known as a mutex lock. It can have only two values â€“ 0 and 1. Its value is initialized to 1. It is used to implement the solution of critical section problems with multiple processes.
- Counting Semaphore: Its value can range over an unrestricted domain. It is used to control access to a resource that has multiple instances.
