**1 .Address**

Definition: An address in networking typically refers to an IP address, which uniquely identifies a device on a network. This can be an IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or an IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Purpose:

The IP address allows devices to locate each other and communicate across the internet or local networks. Each device on a network must have a unique IP address to ensure data is sent to the correct destination.
Structure:

IPv4: Comprised of four octets, represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

IPv6: Longer and more complex, represented as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

**2. Port**

Definition: A port is a numerical identifier in the range of 0 to 65535 that is associated with a specific process or service on a device. It allows multiple applications or services to run on the same IP address simultaneously.
Purpose:

Ports help differentiate between different services or applications running on the same IP address. For example, a web server may run on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS), while an FTP server may use port 21.

Common Ports:
- HTTP: Port 80
- HTTPS: Port 443
- FTP: Port 21
- SSH: Port 22
- SMTP: Port 25 (for sending emails)
- POP3: Port 110 (for retrieving emails)
- IMAP: Port 143

Key Concepts of Ports:

Range: Ports are numbered from 0 to 65535. They are divided into three categories:
- Well-Known Ports (0-1023): Reserved for common services (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443).
- Registered Ports (1024-49151): Assigned to specific applications by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
- Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-65535): Often used for ephemeral ports in client-server communications.
Purpose:

Ports allow multiple applications to use the same IP address without conflict. For example, a server can run a web service on port 80 and an FTP service on port 21.

Usage in Networking: When a device sends data over the network, it specifies both the destination IP address and port number, ensuring that the data reaches the correct service.
For example, a browser connecting to a website typically uses port 80 for HTTP requests.

You can check the currently used ports on your system with commands like netstat -an (on Windows) or sudo lsof -i -P -n (on Linux).
